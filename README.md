HDMI & SPDIF Bit-Stream Format Enabler for Windows 11

This repository provides a single Windows Registry (.reg) file that enables native HDMI and S/PDIF bit-stream output of modern multi-channel audio codecs on Windows 11. It:

    Removes any legacy or malformed codec entries

    Re-adds proper support for AC-3, DTS, E-AC-3 (Dolby Digital Plus), DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD

    Targets both 32-bit and 64-bit registry hives
    
Features

    Cleans out old or broken SPDIF_Formats entries in both the 32-bit and 64-bit registry views

    Recreates codec support entries under:

        HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\SPDIF_Formats

        HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\SPDIF_Formats

    Ensures HDMI endpoints that physically support bit-streaming will expose each format in Supported Formats

    Leaves Windows’ Protected Audio Path intact (no DRM hacks)

Supported Codecs

    Dolby Digital (AC-3)

    DTS Digital Surround

    Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3)

    DTS-HD Master Audio

    Dolby TrueHD

    Note: DTS:X is object-based and rides on top of DTS-HD or E-AC-3 containers. Enabling DTS-HD and E-AC-3 suffices for DTS:X pass-through.

How It Works

    Removal Deletes both 32-bit and 64-bit SPDIF_Formats keys to wipe out stale or incorrect entries.

    Recreation (32-bit) Writes new subkeys under the WOW6432Node hive for each supported codec, specifying a test-file resource in mmres.dll.

    Recreation (64-bit) Mirrors the same codec subkeys under the native MMDevices\SPDIF_Formats hive, ensuring 64-bit audio endpoints pick them up.

After import and a reboot (or a restart of the Windows Audio and Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation services), any HDMI or S/PDIF output device whose driver advertises bit-stream capability will list these codecs in its Supported Formats tab.
Requirements

    Windows 11 (x64)

    Administrator privileges to import .reg files

    Audio driver with bit-stream support over SPDIF or HDMI

Installation

    Download the enable-bitstream-formats.reg file.

    Backup your registry or create a System Restore point.

    Right-click the .reg file → Merge → accept UAC prompt.

    Reboot your PC

    Detailed Behavior

All actions occur in these registry paths:

    32-bit hive HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\SPDIF_Formats\<Codec-GUID>

    64-bit hive HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\SPDIF_Formats\<Codec-GUID>

Each subkey defines:

    DisplayName – The name shown in the audio control panel

    TestFile – A hex-encoded pointer to a resource inside mmres.dll which verifies format support

By rebuilding these keys, Windows will again offer bit-streaming of AC-3, DTS, E-AC-3, DTS-HD MA and TrueHD on compatible hardware.
Troubleshooting

    If a format still doesn’t appear:

        Open Sound → Playback → select your SPDIF/HDMI device → Properties → Supported Formats.

        Check for any missing codecs.

        Locate your device’s GUID under: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\Audio\Render\<DeviceGUID>\…

        Verify driver version and update from your GPU or motherboard vendor if needed.

    To test actual bit-stream output, use a media player with built-in AC-3/DTS test clips or a Blu-ray test disc.
